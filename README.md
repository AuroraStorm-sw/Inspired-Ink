# Introduction

## Why Inspired Ink?
The thought behind Inspired Ink is to invite creative minds with an itch for expressing themselves in writing to get those ideas down on 'paper', so to say, while also prodiving the opportunity to enjoy fellow writers work and leave comments or feedback.

With many forums for writing singling out a specific kind of creative writing, say fiction or poems, Inspired Ink offers a wider variety of categories for your work so that you don't have to search for one site per category. This makes it easier for beginners and master alike to share their work in one single space as well as for others to find a varied asortment of works without having to scour the internet depending on what they're looking for.
